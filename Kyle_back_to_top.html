<h2>Kil's Story</h2>
<h3>The beginning</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Kyle who lost his mom and dad.
    Let me tell the very sad story.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Kil woke up in the middle of the night,
    he got out of bed and walked down stairs; as he went down stairs
    he saw two guys standing in front of his mom and dad in the living room,
    so Kil knew to hide in the bathroom, at foot of the stairs.
    As he was peeking through the crack of the door, he could see to the living room.
    From the bathroom, he saw the two guys stabbing his mom and dad, who were in the living room.
    They were able to crawl away. It was when they reached the bathroom door,
    they dropped, right in front of Kil, who was still behind the door. </p>

<h3> Kyle's Revenge</h3>
<p>As the two murderers ran out of the house, Kil moves to his mom and dad
    and starts yelling, “mom!” and “dad! wake up” over and over again. </p>
"""we included a link: the anchor is at line 53 run away"""
<p>Then a boy comes in the house and says they are never going to wake up
    and says my name is Yenn, come with me, I'll help you avenge your mom and dad
    because the same guys killed My mom and dad. Then Kil and Yenn spent one night in the house.
    <a name="vengance"></a>The next day they ate some food and packed for their trip to avenge their parents,
    so they went outside and left the village, started traveling and looking for someone
    to teach them how to avenge their parents. Then they pass out because of the long trip,
    1 or 2 day later they both wake up in a log house and saw an old man
    sitting in front of a fireplace and eating, then the old man says,
    you finally woke up, I thought yall would never wake up. Then Kil asked, the old man
    “can you teach us how to avenge our parents?'' Then the old man starts laughing at Kil and says,
    you have to eat first you can avenge your parents on an empty stomach.
    Then the old man takes food out of the pot and puts the food in 2 bowls
    and gives it to Kil and yenn. “What is yalls names'' said,
    the old man The two boys said, “Kil and Yenn” </p>

<p>there are many ways a man can deal with a situation like this.  they include:</p>
 <ul>   <li>strike back alone</li>
    <li><a href="#vengance">join a squad<a/></li>
    <li>run</li>
    <li>go to the police</li></ul>

<p>If you go the route of striking back alone, consider:</p>
 <ol>   <li>get your equipment:
     <ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map">map</a> </li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass">a compass</a></li>

         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online " target="_blank" >a sword</a></li>

 </ul></li>
    <li>get a good night's sleep</li>
    <li>as you strike out, look for clues</li>
