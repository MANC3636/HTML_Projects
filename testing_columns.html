		<p class="content-box"> The Black Student Fund was founded in 1964 by prescient persons following Brown v Board. The founders sought to promote education equity at the independent schools long before it became popular. As time went on, it became clear the beneficiary students needed more than simple funding support; they needed wrap-around services.  By 2016, our increasing delivery of wrap around services included BSF STEM, which now provides math support and enrichment as well as computer programming instruction.  The service is provided by our Math an’ Coding program (MANC).</p>

		<p>MANC proposes to work with twelve 7th grade Fairfax County Public School students at Rachel Carson Middle School; our goal is to prepare them for a rigorous summer math enrichment that will provide 60 hours of algebra instruction, and 60 hours of geometry instruction.  These 7th graders will work with our Math Master, who will provide ten sessions of intensive pre-algebra instruction, and two hours per week of math homework tutoring.  This tutoring will be provided by twelve Junior Scholars and Girls Who Math tutors from Thomas Jefferson, thus providing such tutor-students with at least 20 community service hours during the grant period. Such dosage also provides our beneficiary students with a 1:1 tutor, student relationship.</p>

		<p>The intermediate goal would be to have all twelve students take Rachel Carson algebra II as eighth graders.  The longer-term goal is that each student’s algebra II grades be .2 percentage points better than their 7th grade math scores.</p>
